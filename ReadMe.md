# Advantages and Disadvantages
## # Advantages
1. The requirements are so comprehensive that I know what I need to do. 

2. I have enough time to meet the necessary requirements.
3. I have learned Java at University. Therefore, I do not have many difficulties in syntax or structure of Java.

## # Disadvantages
1. I have some difficulties when I set up tools or software to build this app. However, I luckily find solution on the Internet and I apply it to solve the problems.

2. Because this app is used command line interface to interact with user, I have to create many Interfaces to access to various functionalities.

3. About the source code, I try my best to write clean, maintainable and well-structured code. However, I think some structures of codes are not really good enough. 

4. Because I usally make reports at University by docx, this is the first time I have written the **.md** file. 
## # Experienced Lessions 
1. I have a chance to learn how to write **.md** file basically and correctly.

2. I learnt that how to organize or write maintainable and well-structured code.
